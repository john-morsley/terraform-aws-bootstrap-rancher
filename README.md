# Terraform - AWS - Bootstrap Rancher

Bootstrapping the Rancher installation.

Prerequisites:

1 - A Kubernetes cluster via https://github.com/john-morsley/terraform-aws-infrastructure-rancher
2 - A Rancher installation via  https://github.com/john-morsley/terraform-aws-install-rancher

This now needs bootstrapping via this project.

Once complete you should be able to browse to your domain, in my case https://rancher.morsley.io, and be presented with Rancher.
